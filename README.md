# Loan Shark 2
Loan Shark 2 is an Android app that keeps track of one's debts - both with borrowers and with creditors. It is a complete rewrite of the original Loan Shark app, which can be found on my GitHub as well. It was reimagined to be simpler and more intuitive; it was also rewritten in Kotlin.

Loan Shark 2 uses the MVVM pattern, which made the data flow simpler and more efficient than it originally was. This ensures that there is much less room for error. Like the original app, the backend is Room Database.
